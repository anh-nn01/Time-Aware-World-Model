<h1> Modified MTS3 World Model </h1>

Modified MTS3 World Models (Multi Time Scale World Models) for evaluation on control tasks. 

The original MTS3 world model is prediction-only, thus it does not interact with the environments and cannot be directly evaluated on control task. We integrate MPPI planner with MTS3 for evaluating and comparing MTS3 with TAWM on control tasks, such as Meta-World and PDE-Control.
